We have few restrictions in our Terms regarding your use of our app

1. Depending on your continued compliance with the Terms of our Services, we grant you a personal, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to install and use a copy of our mobile application that hosts our Services that comes from a marketplace we publish on to a mobile device you own or control.

We may remove metadata associated with the content, and you wave any right to the content and attribution for the content.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback you provide to us are entirely of your own volition. By providing suggestions, you agree that we may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without any compensation or obligation to you.

We have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor the Content users provide to us, but we may at our sole discretion delete and remove Content as we see fit for any reason. This may include violating our terms or submitting Content that violates local laws.

For anything else, you agree to resolve any Claim you have with us arising from our Terms, us, or our Services only as allowed by the State of Washington law in the state of Washington.

If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, it does not mean that we waive the right to enforce them. If any part of our Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from our Terms and does not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions.

Our Services are not intended to be used in any country where such distributions would violate local law or subject us to regulations by another country. We reserve the right to stop our Services in any country or locality.
