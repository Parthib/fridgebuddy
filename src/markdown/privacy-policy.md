# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 16th, 2021**

## 1. In General

The Fridge Buddy app ('we', 'us', 'our') collects only as much data as needed to run except in a few key ways. Though it may change in the future, the exceptions to the rule are the following:

1. Pictures of scanned receipts may be forwarded to a remote server for analysis towards future improvements to our receipt parsing.
2. Some of our dependent libraries may collect additional data about your interactions with the app. For example, our Google AdMobs dependency may collect data on how frequently you interact with the presented ads.
3. Signing in via an external provider automatically provides us with some of your personal information such as your photo, name, and email. These are saved to automatically generate a profile for you.  

If you would like to minimize data collection, you can turn off data and skip signing into the app. If you skip signing in and have data enabled, then we will create an anonymous profile for you.

As new features and improvements come along, we may have to update this privacy policy to reflect how we handle user data differently. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. If we change the way we process your personal information, then we will notify you before the changes are made. If you disagree with any changes, then you must stop using this app and request your data be deleted. We recommend you check in on this privacy policy from time to time. Any continued use of this app after revisions to our privacy policy indicates that you have agreed to the revised privacy policy.

## 2. What We Collect, Why, and Where It Goes

### Overview

We and our supporting third parties collect certain personal data from you. We use this information to

1. Ensure the functionality of our app
2. Improve the functionality of our app
3. Discover trends in how users use our app
4. Collect revenue from ads and user purchases
5. Debug issues found in our app and respond to user feedback

More specifics concerning what we collect, what it is used for, and where the data goes are in the sections below.

### Involved Services

To support the different services in this app, we rely on various cloud services provided by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We mainly use the GCP's Firebase offering to support authentication on the app, and we use AWS to support storing user data like email, name, profile pictures, images, food lists, food data, and any other account or user-generated content.

**Some Other Services include:**
Apple Sign-In: Used to allow you to sign into the app using Apple
Apple In-App Purchases: Used to allow you to make purchases in our app on iOS devices
Facebook Sign-In: Used to allow you to sign into the app using Facebook
Google AdMobs: Used to present ads in the app
Google Analytics: Used to understand how users use our app
Google Sign-In: Used to allow you to sign into the app using Google

### Information You Provide to Us and We Store

#### Account Information

When you sign up for a Fridge Buddy account, you supply us with certain information such as an email and a password. You can also provide us with a profile picture. If you sign in via Apple, Facebook, or Google, then we retrieve information such as your full name, email, and profile picture from these authentication providers. Our authentication is hosted by Firebase, so this information is then forwarded to Firebase to help authenticate you in the future. All this information is also used by our backend service to create a profile for you so that we can back up your user data and associate it with your profile. This lets us do things like load your information on a different device if you happen to log into it or share your lists with others if you decide to share it with them.

#### Content You Create and Change

When you create content in our app such as a list for foods or individual food entries, we back that information up into our backend databases. This information can include things like the name of your list, associated pictures, when you created the list, who created the list, who is on the list, and anything else you see in the content you create. If you decide to share the list with others, then other users will also be allowed to view or even modify the content depending on the permissions you set for other users. Any creation, modification, or deletion of contents is logged in our backend services.

We may also store any pictures taken on the app to help improve image recognition in the future.

#### Transaction Data

If you purchase any subscriptions or products in our app, then we will collect and store certain information regarding the transaction in our database including the time of the transaction, name of the purchaser, the item purchased, any user feedback provided, the duration of the subscription, email, refund information, payment information, and so on. Our app only uses Apple and Android In-App purchasing systems to handle transactions and process payments.


### Information We Automatically Save

#### Usage Data

When you use our app, we automatically collect information about your usage. This information may include your

1. General location or region
2. IP address
3. Phone type
4. Operating system
5. Device information
6. Device settings
7. Date and time

### Information Saved from Other Sources

#### Linked Services

If you allow for using a third-party authorization service like Apple, Facebook, or Google to be used to sign into our app, then they may provide us with information such as your name, phone number, email, and profile picture. We store this data in our backend and associate it with your profile.

### Information Collected by Third Parties

Our app uses third-party software that collects user information. For example, we use Google AdMobs to supply the app with ads. These third parties are governed by their privacy policies that we have no control over. As a result, these third parties are not covered by this privacy policy but rather by the privacy policy of the service that hosts the third party.

#### Usage Patterns

We use the analytics tools provided by Google Play and Apple to understand how our users are interacting with our app.

### How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. However, your personal information may be shared with others in ways beyond what was outlined in certain situations:

1. We may provide personal information to authorities to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable government request.
2. We may examine personal information to the extent needed to address and prevent fraud, security, or technical issues.
3. We may examine personal information to the extent needed to enforce our Terms, Policies, and rights. This includes investigations of potential violations.
4. We may provide personal information if it is needed in cases to prevent imminent bodily harm to a person.
5. We may share and publish anonymized data regarding our app. The data will be anonymized such that it cannot be reasonably used to identify individual users of our app. For example, we may publish statistics on the number of installations our app has seen.

### How We Protect Your Information

This app takes a few measures to ensure that your personal information. Namely, we perform most API calls in our app via HTTPS so that the data transmitted remains encrypted. We also use trusted cloud services such as GCP and AWS for storing user data to ensure our user data is as safe as possible from malicious third parties. However, please keep in mind that this app was designed and created by one developer as a side project. There may easily be security vulnerabilities in our app's design, so please limit the data you share with us to what you are comfortable with.

### Data Retention

We store your user data and content as long as you are a member of our platform. This is done to provide a consistent user experience on our app. In addition to this, any relevant legal retention period applies for the duration of the storage of personal data. We regularly clean our logs and other unneeded user data after this deadline.

If you decide that you no longer want to use our app and also want us to delete your data, then you are free to contact us with your account details to begin the process of account deletion. If you would like the data we have associated with your account, then you are also welcome to reach out to us (see the contact us section below).

 Additionally, you have the option to initiate an automated process for data deletion by visiting the [request account deletion](/request-account-deletion) page. This process will permanently remove all personal information associated with your account, including your profile, content you've created, the account itself, and any other stored data. Please note that once this data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

However, if you have shared information with other users (such as by sharing a list), that information may not be deleted. Once data is shared, it becomes a shared resource without a clear owner and may remain accessible to others even after your account is deleted.

This applies to both manually requested and automated account deletions.

Please note that any permanent and subscription purchases are tied exclusively to the account on which they were made. Deleting your account will result in the loss of these purchases and their associated benefits, which cannot be recovered. Additionally, account deletions do not automatically cancel any existing subscriptions. Users must manually cancel subscriptions by visiting the App Store or Google Play Store.

### Children's Information

Our app and services are not intended to be used by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes that their child has disclosed personally identifiable information on our platform(s), then please reach out to us using the contact information provided at the end of this document. A parent or guardian can initiate the process of reviewing and requesting the deletion of a child's personal information on our platform.
